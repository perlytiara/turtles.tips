**What it does**

This program is a test implementation for a turtle-based upward quarry in CC:Tweaked (ComputerCraft), created by BigGamingGamers. For details on its functionality, refer to the embedded video.

**Setup**

- Requires a mining turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and inventory space for collected items.
- Download the program in-game using wget from GitHub: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/upward-quarry-test.lua` (adjust URL if needed based on the author's repository).

**Usage**

Place the turtle at the starting position and run `upward-quarry-test`. Main options and parameters are demonstrated in the video—watch for configuration examples.

**Tips**

Ensure the turtle has enough fuel for the quarry height to avoid interruptions. Test in a safe area to prevent unexpected behavior.
