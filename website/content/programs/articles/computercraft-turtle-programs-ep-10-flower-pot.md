### What it does
This turtle program automates decorating your Minecraft home by having a turtle regularly swap out flowers in a flower pot, adding a dynamic touch to your builds.

### Setup
You'll need a ComputerCraft turtle (compatible with CC:Tweaked), fuel for the turtle, a flower pot, and various flowers or plants to cycle through. The program is demonstrated in the video using the FTB Direwolf20 1.7 modpack with ComputerCraft. Watch the embedded video for the full code and implementation details, as no direct pastebin link is provided.

### Usage
Place the turtle near the flower pot and run the program (details in the video). It will periodically detect and replace the flower, creating a changing display. Customize flower types based on your inventory.
