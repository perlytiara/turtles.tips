**What it does**  
tClear is a ComputerCraft program for turtles that clears a specified area by digging blocks.

**Setup**  
- Equip a mining turtle with fuel (e.g., coal).  
- Install the program in-game using: `pastebin get <code> tClear` (replace `<code>` with the actual Pastebin ID if available) or download from the path perlytiara/tClear.

**Usage**  
Run `tClear` followed by parameters like width, length, and height (e.g., `tClear 5 10 3`). The turtle will dig the area starting from its position. Watch the video for detailed examples.

**Tips**  
Refuel the turtle mid-task if the area is large. Ensure the turtle has space for collected items or add a chest for dumping.
