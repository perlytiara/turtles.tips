**What it does**

aTreeFarm is a CC:Tweaked turtle program by Kaikaku that automates tree farming, handling planting, chopping, and collection.

**Setup**

Equip a mining turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and saplings in its inventory. Download the program in-game via wget from a repository or pastebin (refer to the video for the exact command, such as `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaikaku/repo/aTreeFarm.lua`). Place the turtle in a suitable farming area.

**Usage**

Run the program with `aTreeFarm` in the turtle's terminal. Configure options like farm size or tree type as shown in the video. The turtle will plant saplings, wait for growth, harvest logs, and repeat.

**Tips**

Ensure the turtle has enough inventory space for logs and drops. Watch the video for setup visuals and troubleshooting common issues like fuel management.
