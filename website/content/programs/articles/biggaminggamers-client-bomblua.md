**Setup**

The program is available at the path BigGamingGamers/client-bomb.lua (likely a GitHub repository). In CC:Tweaked, download it using a command like `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/client-bomb/main/client-bomb.lua` (adjust the URL as needed). Ensure your turtle has fuel and any required peripherals based on the program's function.

**Usage**

Run the program with `client-bomb` in the turtle's terminal. For specific options, functionality, and what it does, refer to the embedded YouTube video.
