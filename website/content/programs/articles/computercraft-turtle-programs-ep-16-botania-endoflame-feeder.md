### What it does
This turtle program creates a compact feeder for Botania's Endoflames, designed to fit in a smaller space than Direwolf20's challenge setup. It automates feeding the flowers in a 3-block or smaller contraption using ComputerCraft turtles.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A ComputerCraft turtle (from the Computercraft mod), fuel for the turtle, and Botania mod installed (tested on FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12 pack with ComputerCraft v1.80pr1). Ensure the turtle is placed in a suitable spot near your Endoflames.
- **Installation**: In-game, run `pastebin get bMHsGY06 aEndoFeeder` to download the program.

### Usage
Run the program by typing `aEndoFeeder`. Starting without parameters displays info screens with usage details. Refer to the video for setup visuals and parameter options.
