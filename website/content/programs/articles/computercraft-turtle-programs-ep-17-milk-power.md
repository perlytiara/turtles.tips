### What it does
This turtle program automates milking cows to generate free energy using living beings in a modded Minecraft setup (e.g., FTB Direwolf20 1.12). Note that recent nerfs have reduced power output and removed a required recipe, which may vary by modpack.

### Setup
- Requires a ComputerCraft turtle (from CC:Tweaked or ComputerCraft mod).
- Ensure the turtle has fuel and necessary items like buckets for milking.
- Download the program in-game: `pastebin get e8bs7VnN aMilkPower`.

### Usage
Place the turtle near cows and run `aMilkPower` to start the automation. Refer to the video for setup details and energy generation process.

### Tips
No animals are harmed in the process. Check the video outtakes for fun extras, and watch for modpack-specific changes due to nerfs.
