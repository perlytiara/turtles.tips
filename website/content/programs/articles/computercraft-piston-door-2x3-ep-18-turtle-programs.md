### What it does
This turtle program automates the construction of a 2x3 piston door in Minecraft using CC:Tweaked, integrating turtles with redstone components for functional doors. It includes demos for standard and underground setups.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A turtle (e.g., advanced turtle), fuel for the turtle, building blocks (such as sticky pistons, redstone, and door materials), and redstone components. Ensure you're in a modpack like FTB Direwolf20 1.16 with CC:Tweaked installed.
- **Getting the program**: On a computer or turtle, run `pastebin get BvavMNTW bDoor2x3` to download the script.

### Usage
Place the turtle in the starting position with necessary blocks in its inventory. Run the program by typing `bDoor2x3` on the turtle. For details on configuration and options, watch the video sections on program demo (03:44) and details (05:20).

### Tips
Check the "Underground" demo (09:52) for adapting the door to hidden or subterranean builds. Refer to the CC:Tweaked wiki for turtle API specifics.
