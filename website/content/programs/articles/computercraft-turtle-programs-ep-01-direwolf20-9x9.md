### What it does
This ComputerCraft turtle program, `build_9x9`, automates the construction of a 9x9 building structure inspired by Direwolf20's designs in Minecraft. It's ideal for quickly setting up bases or rooms using turtles.

### Setup
You'll need a fueled turtle with building blocks in its inventory (e.g., stone or wood). Download the program via Pastebin: in-game, run `pastebin get a5nWDnK6 build_9x9` (note: the original Pastebin ID is from an older version; ensure compatibility with CC:Tweaked).

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position and run `build_9x9`. The program handles the building process automatically—watch the video for step-by-step usage and any parameters. For issues, refer to the video comments.

### Tips
This program is from the FTB Direwolf20 modpack era; test in modern setups. Check out Direwolf20's channel for building inspiration.
