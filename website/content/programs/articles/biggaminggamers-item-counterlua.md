### What it does
This program allows a CC:Tweaked turtle to count items in inventories or chests, useful for automation and inventory management in Minecraft.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and access to chests or inventories to scan.
- **Installation**: In-game, use `wget` to download the program:  
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/item-counter.lua` (adjust URL if needed based on the repository). Save it as `item-counter`.

### Usage
Place the turtle near the target inventory. Run the program with `item-counter` in the turtle's terminal. Follow any on-screen prompts for options like specifying slots or output formats. For details on commands and features, watch the embedded video.

### Tips
Ensure the turtle has peripheral access (e.g., via modem) if counting remote inventories. Test in a safe area to avoid item loss.
