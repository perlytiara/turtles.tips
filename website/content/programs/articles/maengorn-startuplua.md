**What it does**  
This is a startup script by Maengorn for CC:Tweaked turtles, designed to run automatically on boot. (Refer to the embedded video for details on its functionality.)

**Setup**  
- Equip a turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and access to a computer.  
- Download the program in-game using a command like `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maengorn/repo/main/startup.lua` (adjust URL if needed) or via pastebin if available. Name the file `startup.lua` for auto-execution.

**Usage**  
Place the script as `startup` on the turtle. Reboot the turtle to run it. Check the video for specific options or behaviors.
