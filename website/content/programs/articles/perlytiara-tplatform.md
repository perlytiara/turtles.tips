**What it does**  
This program enables a turtle to build or manage platforms in CC:Tweaked. Watch the embedded video for a full demonstration.

**Setup**  
- Prepare a turtle with sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) and any required blocks in its inventory.  
- Download the program in-game: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perlytiara/tPlatform/main/tPlatform.lua tPlatform` (adjust if the repo structure differs).

**Usage**  
- Run the program with `tPlatform` followed by any parameters shown in the video (e.g., size or direction).  
- The turtle will execute the platform-building task autonomously.

**Tips**  
Refuel the turtle if the platform is large to avoid interruptions. See the video for optimization ideas.
