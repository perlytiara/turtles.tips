**What it does**  
This turtle program automates building a town house structure in Minecraft using ComputerCraft turtles. It's based on a design from BeardedMan's video and demonstrated in a separate usage video.

**Setup**  
You'll need a fueled turtle with sufficient building blocks in its inventory (specific materials depend on the design—watch the video for details). Download the program via pastebin: in-game, run `pastebin get FHw76UHP build_TownHouse`. This is for ComputerCraft (compatible with CC:Tweaked) in modpacks like FTB Direwolf20.

**Usage**  
Place the turtle at the starting position and run `build_TownHouse`. The video explains the exact setup, material requirements, and how the turtle constructs the house step-by-step. For troubleshooting, check the comments on the YouTube video.

**Tips**  
Refer to the linked videos for the original design and a practical example of using this program in a larger build. If you encounter issues, leave a comment on the video for help from the author.
