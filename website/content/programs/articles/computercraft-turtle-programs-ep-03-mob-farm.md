### What it does
This program allows a normal turtle to automatically build a mob farm in Minecraft, providing an early-game source of experience and mob drops. No diamond tools are required for the turtle.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A normal turtle (from ComputerCraft), sufficient fuel for the turtle, and building materials (e.g., blocks for the farm structure—check the video for specifics).
- **Getting the program**: Download from Pastebin using the command `pastebin get unPPhDpQ build_MobFarm` in the turtle's terminal.

### Usage
Place the turtle in the starting position as shown in the video. Run the program with `build_MobFarm` followed by options (e.g., for size or configuration—details explained in the video, excluding two hidden decorative options). Watch the timelapse in the video to see it in action.

### Tips
The program has been updated so the turtle no longer runs away when shift-clicking materials into its inventory. If you encounter issues, refer to the video comments for help.
