**What it does**

This program helps a ComputerCraft turtle refuel using lava. See the embedded video for full details on its functionality.

**Setup**

- Equip a turtle with access to lava buckets (e.g., in its inventory or nearby).
- Download the program in-game using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/lava-refueler.lua` (adjust URL if needed) or via pastebin if available.

**Usage**

Run the program with `lava-refueler` in the turtle's terminal. Follow any on-screen prompts for refueling options as shown in the video.

**Tips**

Ensure the turtle has enough inventory space for lava buckets to avoid errors.
