### What it does
This program automates a turtle to function as a quarry, mining out a specified area in your Minecraft world using CC:Tweaked.

### Setup
- Equip a mining turtle with a pickaxe in its inventory.
- Ensure the turtle has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal or lava buckets).
- Install the program in-game by running `pastebin get perlytiara/quarry quarry` (adjust if using a different method, or download from the author's source).

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position facing the direction you want to mine. Run the program with `quarry [width] [depth] [height]` (or similar arguments; check in-game help or the video for exact syntax). The turtle will dig systematically, collecting resources.

### Tips
Refuel the turtle periodically for large quarries. Watch the embedded video for a visual walkthrough and advanced options.
