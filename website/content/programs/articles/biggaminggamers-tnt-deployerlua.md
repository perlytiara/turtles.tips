### What it does
This program allows a CC:Tweaked turtle to deploy TNT blocks, useful for mining or automated explosions in Minecraft.

### Setup
- Equip a turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and TNT in its inventory.
- Download the program in-game: Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/tnt-deployer.lua` (adjust URL if needed) or use pastebin if available.

### Usage
- Place the turtle where you want to start deploying.
- Run the program with `tnt-deployer` (add arguments if the script supports them, like quantity or direction—check the code or video for details).
- The turtle will place TNT based on the script's logic.

### Tips
Ensure the area is safe to avoid unintended explosions. Watch the embedded video for a demo and customization ideas.
