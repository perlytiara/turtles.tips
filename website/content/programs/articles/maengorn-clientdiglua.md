### Setup
- Ensure you have a turtle with sufficient fuel and any required tools (e.g., for digging).
- Download the program in-game using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maengorn/clientdig.lua` (adjust URL if needed based on the author's repository).

### Usage
- Run the program with `lua clientdig.lua` or simply `clientdig`.
- Refer to the embedded video for specific commands, options, and what the program does, as it demonstrates the turtle's behavior.

### Tips
- Monitor fuel levels during operation to avoid interruptions.
