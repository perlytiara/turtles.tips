### What it does
This turtle program builds Grian's Chandelier from Hermitcraft Season 7, Episode 19. It automates the construction process inside a suitable space, such as a dome (demonstrated in the video).

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle with necessary building blocks (e.g., glass, iron bars, sea lanterns—refer to the video or Grian's original for exact materials). Ensure the turtle is placed in a prepared area like a dome for the chandelier to fit.
- **Getting the program**: Run `pastebin get bMky9MzP bChandelier` in the turtle's terminal.

### Usage
Position the turtle at the starting point (see video timestamp 15:06 for setup details). Run `bChandelier` to begin building. The program handles placement automatically—watch the timelapse at 11:45 for an example.

### Tips
Build a dome or enclosure first (as shown in the 04:18 timelapse) to house the chandelier. For inspiration, check Grian's video linked in the description. Ensure the turtle has enough fuel and inventory space.
