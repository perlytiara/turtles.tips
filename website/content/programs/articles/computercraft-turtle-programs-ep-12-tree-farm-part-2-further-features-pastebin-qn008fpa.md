### What it does
This program extends the automated tree farm from part 1, adding features like redstone-based stopping and running the farm for a specified number of turns. It also includes a "tree contest" to compare yields from different tree types.

### Setup
You'll need a fueled turtle with tools and inventory space, as set up in part 1 (watch the linked video for basics). Download the program using `pastebin get Qn008fPa treefarm` (or similar filename) in your turtle's terminal.

### Usage
Run the program with `treefarm` (adjust based on your filename). Key options include:
- Redstone stop: Apply a redstone signal to halt the turtle mid-operation.
- Run for x turns: Specify the number of cycles (e.g., via arguments or in-program settings) to limit farming duration.

For full details on integration with part 1, watch the video.

### Tips
Check the "tree contest" segment in the video to see which tree types provide the best yields for your farm. Refer to part 1 for initial setup: [Tree farm part 1](http://youtu.be/eMxNI2QjO1k).
