### What it does
This program instructs a ComputerCraft turtle to automatically build a space shuttle structure. The standard design primarily uses blocks from the Chisel mod.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle with sufficient inventory slots filled with the required building blocks (mostly from the Chisel mod; refer to the video for details). Ensure the turtle has enough fuel for movement and placement.
- **Getting the program**: In-game, use `pastebin get L1UQ3he3 shuttle` (or your preferred filename) to download from Pastebin.

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position and run the program with `shuttle` (or the filename you chose). The turtle will construct the space shuttle based on the predefined design. Watch the video for setup visuals and any custom options.

### Tips
This build is a small part of a potential larger project—check the video for inspiration on integrating it into bigger structures. If you lack the Chisel mod, substitute blocks as needed, but results may vary.
