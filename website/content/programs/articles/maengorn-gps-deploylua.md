### What it does
The gps-deploy program enables a turtle to automatically deploy a GPS system in CC:Tweaked, setting up coordinate-tracking infrastructure.

### Setup
- Equip a turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and any required blocks for building.
- Download the program in-game using: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maengorn/gps-deploy.lua` (adjust URL if needed, based on the GitHub path Maengorn/gps-deploy.lua).

### Usage
Run the program with `gps-deploy` followed by any options (e.g., for tower height or position). Refer to the embedded video for detailed commands and examples.

### Tips
Ensure the turtle has enough inventory space for materials. Test in a safe area to avoid overwriting existing structures.
