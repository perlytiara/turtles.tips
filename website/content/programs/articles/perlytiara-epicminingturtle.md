**What it does**  
EpicMiningTurtle is a CC:Tweaked program that automates mining operations with a turtle, handling excavation and resource collection efficiently.

**Setup**  
- Equip a mining turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and any necessary tools.  
- Download the program in-game using: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perlytiara/EpicMiningTurtle/main/program.lua` (adjust path if needed) or via pastebin if available.  

**Usage**  
Run the program with `lua program.lua` (or the downloaded filename). Follow on-screen prompts for mining dimensions or options. For details on commands and customization, watch the embedded video.

**Tips**  
Ensure the turtle has enough inventory space and fuel for large mining jobs. Test in a safe area to avoid losing resources.
