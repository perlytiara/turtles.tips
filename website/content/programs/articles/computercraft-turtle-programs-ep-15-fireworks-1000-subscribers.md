### What it does
This turtle program creates fireworks displays in Minecraft using ComputerCraft turtles, designed to celebrate milestones like 1000 subscribers or events like New Year's Eve.

### Setup
- You'll need a turtle from ComputerCraft (included in mods like FTB Skyfactory 2.5).
- Ensure the turtle has fuel (e.g., coal) and any required blocks or items for fireworks (details in the video).
- Download the program in-game: Place a turtle, open its terminal, and run `pastebin get UYm0CCQ7 fireworks` (replace "fireworks" with your preferred filename).

### Usage
Run the program by typing its filename (e.g., `fireworks`) in the turtle's terminal. Follow the video for specific setup and execution steps, as it demonstrates the fireworks in action.
