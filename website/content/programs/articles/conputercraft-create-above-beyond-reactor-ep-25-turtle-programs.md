### What it does
This ComputerCraft Turtle program automates the mass production of quantum entangled singularities in Chapter 3 of the Create Above and Beyond modpack, serving as a utility tool for efficient resource generation.

### Setup
You'll need a fueled Turtle equipped for building and item handling in Minecraft with the Create Above and Beyond modpack (or similar, like Direwolf20 1.16). For program installation, watch the video demo starting at 01:58 for code details, then enter it manually in-game or adapt from the shown script. Refer to the CC:Tweaked wiki for Turtle basics if needed.

### Usage
Place the Turtle in your setup as demonstrated in the video. Run the program via the Turtle's interface to start automation. The demo covers the full process from 01:58 to 09:03, including configuration for your reactor build.
