### What it does
This program allows a turtle to build a half-timber house in Minecraft using ComputerCraft. It offers options to build a full house or just one story, and to include a door or not.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle with sufficient building materials (specific blocks are shown in the video). The program is designed for ComputerCraft in modpacks like Direwolf20.
- **Getting the program**: In-game, run `pastebin get hxeZ5Wui bHalfTimberHouse` to download it from Pastebin.

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position (as demonstrated in the video). Run the program with `bHalfTimberHouse`. It prompts for two options:
- Build full house or only one story.
- Include a door or not.

The program can be used with multiple turtles for building multiple houses simultaneously, as shown in the time-lapse.
