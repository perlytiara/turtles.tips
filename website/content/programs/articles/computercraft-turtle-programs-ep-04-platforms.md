### What it does
This program allows a ComputerCraft turtle to build rectangular platforms of any size. It can be combined with multiple program calls to create more complex structures, such as buildings.

### Setup
You'll need a fueled turtle with building blocks in its inventory. Download the program from Pastebin (as mentioned in the video) and run it on your turtle. Note: The video references related programs like build_MobFarm (Pastebin: fbyxVzSX), but check the video for the exact tPlatform code.

### Usage
Run the program by typing `tPlatform` followed by parameters for platform dimensions (e.g., length, width). The turtle will build the platform automatically. Refer to the video for detailed examples, including combining calls for advanced builds. The program selects slot 1 at startup and notifies you if manual refueling is needed.

### Tips
Use this for quick foundations in larger projects. Watch the timelapse scenes in the video for inspiration on applications like mob farms or 9x9 structures. If issues arise, leave a comment on the video for help.
