### What it does
This program automates a tree farm using a ComputerCraft turtle, harvesting thousands of wood blocks. It supports optional setup by the turtle and works with either a crafty felling turtle or a crafty mining turtle.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A crafty felling turtle or crafty mining turtle (from ComputerCraft mod). Ensure the turtle has fuel for movement and operations.
- **Download**: In-game, run `pastebin get Qn008fPa aTreeFarm` to download the program (original pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Qn008fPa).

### Usage
Place the turtle in the starting position (note: v1.40 update fixes start position bugs). Run the program with `aTreeFarm`. The turtle can optionally set up the farm area before running; it then automates planting, growing, and harvesting trees. For full mechanics, watch the video.

### Tips
Ideal for early-game wood gathering in modpacks like FTB Direwolf20. The video is split into two parts, but Part 1 covers all essentials for running the program.
