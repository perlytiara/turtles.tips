### What it does
This program enables a turtle to construct dome-shaped tunnels in CC:Tweaked.

### Setup
- Equip a mining turtle with fuel (e.g., coal) and building materials in its inventory.
- Download the program in-game: Run `pastebin get perlytiara/dome_tunnels dome_tunnels` (adjust if using wget from a custom repo).

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position and run `dome_tunnels` with optional arguments for size or materials (refer to the embedded video for details).

### Tips
Ensure the turtle has enough fuel for large structures; watch the video for optimization examples.
