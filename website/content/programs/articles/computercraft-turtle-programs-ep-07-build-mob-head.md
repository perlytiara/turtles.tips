### What it does
This program allows a turtle to build over 16 different 8x8 mob heads in Minecraft. Heads can be constructed horizontally (as a platform) or vertically (like a wall).

### Setup
- You'll need a turtle (such as a mining or crafting turtle) with sufficient fuel and the necessary blocks in its inventory for the chosen mob head.
- Download the program in-game using: `pastebin get HP3AW3sd buildHead` (or visit http://pastebin.com/HP3AW3sd).

### Usage
Run the program with `buildHead` followed by options for the specific mob head and orientation (horizontal or vertical). For the exact list of supported heads and commands, check the video or program code.

### Tips
The program is designed for community inclusion in ComputerCraft—watch the time-lapse in the video for inspiration on large-scale builds with multiple turtles.
