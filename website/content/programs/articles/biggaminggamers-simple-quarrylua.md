**What it does**  
This program turns a CC:Tweaked turtle into a simple quarry, mining out a designated area. For full details, watch the embedded video.

**Setup**  
- Equip a turtle with a pickaxe (e.g., diamond) in its inventory.  
- Ensure the turtle has fuel (e.g., coal).  
- Download the program in-game: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigGamingGamers/simple-quarry.lua` (adjust URL if needed based on the author's repo).

**Usage**  
Place the turtle at the starting position, then run `simple-quarry` with optional arguments for size (e.g., `simple-quarry 16 16` for a 16x16 area). It will mine forward and downward systematically.
