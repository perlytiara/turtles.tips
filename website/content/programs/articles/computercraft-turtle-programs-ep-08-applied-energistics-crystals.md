### What it does
This turtle program automates crystal growth for an Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) ME system. It manages pure certus quartz, pure nether quartz, pure fluix, and regular fluix crystals.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle integrated with an AE2 system (e.g., via ME interfaces or cables). Ensure you have AE2 seeds and growth accelerators set up as shown in the video.
- **Installation**: In your turtle, run `pastebin get stXEtJ6C aAESeeds` to download the program.

### Usage
Place the turtle in your AE2 crystal growth setup. Run the program with `aAESeeds` to start automating crystal management. The default sleep time between checks is 20 seconds (updated in 2015).

### Tips
For an introduction to AE2, check the linked video by direwolf20. Adjust sleep time if needed for your setup—see the video for details on configuration and integration.
