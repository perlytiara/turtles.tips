### What it does
This turtle program automates building the pixel art entrance to a "Donkey Sanctuary" inspired by Genericb's design, as shown in the video. It also includes a time lapse for building additional donkey structures using a special turtle (T17) with enhanced capabilities.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle (e.g., with coal or other fuel), and sufficient building blocks in its inventory (specific materials depend on the pixel art; refer to the video for details). This program is designed for ComputerCraft in mods like FTB Direwolf20.
- **Installation**: In-game, use `pastebin get Xc98RnqU bDonkeySanctuary` to download the program.

### Usage
Place the turtle at the starting position as demonstrated in the video, ensure it has the necessary blocks, and run `bDonkeySanctuary`. Watch the video for positioning and execution steps, including the second time lapse for extra donkeys.

### Tips
Check out the original pixel art build by Genericb linked in the video description for inspiration. The special turtle T17 features additional tricks—see the episode for more on its capabilities.
