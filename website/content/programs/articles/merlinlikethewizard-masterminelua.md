**What it does**  
Mastermine is a turtle program designed for automated mining in CC:Tweaked (ComputerCraft), allowing turtles to excavate resources efficiently.

**Setup**  
- Requires a turtle with fuel (e.g., coal or lava).  
- Download the program in-game using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MerlinLikeTheWizard/mastermine.lua` or via pastebin if available. Save it as `mastermine`.

**Usage**  
Run the program with `mastermine` followed by optional arguments for mining parameters (e.g., depth or area). Refer to the embedded video for specific commands and demonstrations.

**Tips**  
Ensure the turtle has inventory space for collected items; refuel periodically for longer runs. Watch the video for optimization strategies.
