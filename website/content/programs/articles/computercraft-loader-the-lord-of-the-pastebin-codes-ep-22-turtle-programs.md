### What it does
tLoader is a ComputerCraft turtle program that simplifies loading multiple Pastebin codes. It acts as a central loader ("one Pastebin code to rule them all") to fetch and manage other programs on your turtle's hard drive.

### Setup
- Requires a basic turtle in Minecraft with CC:Tweaked (e.g., in FTB Direwolf20 1.16 modpack).
- No additional fuel or blocks needed for basic use.
- Download via Pastebin: Run `pastebin get TUAPv1FU tLoader` on your turtle.

### Usage
- Run the program with `tLoader`.
- It loads and binds other programs from Pastebin (demo shown with tPlatform in the video).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to select and install programs.
