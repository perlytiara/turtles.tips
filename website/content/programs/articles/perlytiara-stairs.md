**What it does**  
This program enables a ComputerCraft turtle to build stairs automatically in your Minecraft world.

**Setup**  
- Equip a turtle with sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) and building blocks in its inventory.  
- Download the program in-game using: `pastebin get <code> stairs` (replace `<code>` with the actual Pastebin code if available) or via wget from a repository like perlytiara/stairs.

**Usage**  
Run the program with `stairs` followed by any parameters for length, height, or material (check the video for specific options). Position the turtle facing the starting direction before execution.

**Tips**  
Ensure the turtle has enough inventory space for blocks and watch the embedded video for a visual demo of setup and results.
