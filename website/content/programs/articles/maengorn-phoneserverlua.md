**Setup**

This program is designed for a ComputerCraft turtle (likely requiring a wireless modem). Download it in-game using `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maengorn/phone_server.lua` (adjust the URL if needed based on the exact GitHub repository path).

**Usage**

Run the program with `phone_server`. For configuration options and detailed usage, refer to the embedded YouTube video.

**Tips**

Ensure your turtle has fuel and is equipped for networking tasks, as shown in the video.
