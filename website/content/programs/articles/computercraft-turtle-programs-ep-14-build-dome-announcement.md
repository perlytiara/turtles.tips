### What it does
This program instructs a ComputerCraft turtle to build a 51x51x21 dome structure in Minecraft, using provided building materials.

### Setup
- **Requirements**: A fueled turtle with sufficient building blocks in its inventory (e.g., stone or other materials for the dome). Ensure the turtle has enough fuel for the build.
- **Getting the program**: Use the in-game command `pastebin get [code]` (Pastebin code is shown in the video at 13:22). Place the turtle correctly as demonstrated in the video (see timestamps 10:28 and 17:18 for placement details).

### Usage
Position the turtle at the base of the intended dome location, facing the correct direction (refer to video for exact setup). Run the program by typing its name in the turtle's terminal. The build process will start automatically, creating the dome layer by layer—watch the time lapse in the video at 18:23 for an example.

### Tips
Experiment with variations like half-domes, force field-style shields, or different materials by adjusting the program or inventory. Share your creations in the video comments for feedback!
