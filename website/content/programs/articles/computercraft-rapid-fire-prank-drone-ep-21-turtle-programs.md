### What it does
This program turns a turtle into a prank drone that can drop items like arrows or TNT. It supports a regular drone or a rapid-fire version capable of launching up to 2880 arrows in one go, all controllable via wireless commands.

### Setup
You'll need a turtle equipped with a wireless modem, sufficient fuel (e.g., coal), and items to drop (arrows or TNT). Download the program in-game using: `pastebin get A35d84ge bDrone`. Ensure you're using CC:Tweaked in a compatible modpack like Direwolf20 1.16.

### Usage
Run the program with `bDrone` to build the drone. Choose between regular or rapid-fire modes during setup. Use wireless commands to position the drone and trigger the "fire" command to release items. For refilling, the program includes a refill option to restock the drone.

### Tips
Be cautious with TNT—select targets wisely to avoid unintended destruction. Test on yourself for fun, as shown in the self-experiment section of the video. For more details on turtle basics, check the linked intro video.
